Personal coding project to learn different CFD/numerical methods

The goal of this project is for me to practice my Fortran development skills and to learn CFD and related numerical methods.

The code solves the 3D Euler Equations on an unstructured 3D grid (current support for tetrahedral and prism cells) using the Finite Volume Method (FVM).  The core design is heavily based off of the 2D CCFV Educational Euler Code and 3D NCFV codes developed by Dr. Hiroaki Nishikawa, and available at http://ossanworld.com/cfdbooks/cfdcodes.html.  Demo input files can be found in the "demo" directory.
